# Cost Benefits allocation on EC
Welcome to the Cost-Benefits allocation on energy communitires repository.
This code piece has been created as support material for the paper titled "A simple and efficient method to allocate costs and benefits in energy communities" (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372482476_A_simple_and_efficient_method_to_allocate_costs_and_benefits_in_energy_communities)

The purpose of these scripts is to reproduce the graphical results presented in the paper, in particular, the "Ejecutar1_Modelo 5_paper_contenidos.R" script generates the illustrations () and the "Ejecutar2_Modelo 5_paper_comparativa" script generates the illustrations ().
